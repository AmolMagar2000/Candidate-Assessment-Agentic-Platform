CODING TOPICS FOR JAVA DEVELOPER:
1. Algorithmic Logic
   - Sliding window problems (maximum sum subarray, min length substring)
   - Find the longest subarray with unique elements
   - Merge overlapping intervals
   - Longest substring without repeating characters
   - Detect cycle in a linked list
   - Binary search variations (rotated array, peak element)
   - Reverse a linked list (iterative and recursive)

2.  Data Structures
   - Implement stack/queue from scratch using arrays or linked lists
   - HashMap for frequency counting and indexing
   - Custom comparator for sorting complex objects
   - Tree traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
   - Heap operations (find kth largest element)
   - Generate all permutations and combinations of a given set/string
   - N-Queens problem
   - Word search in a 2D grid (backtracking)
   - Edit distance (Levenshtein distance)

3. Dynamic Programming Basics
   - Fibonacci sequence
   - Coin change problem
   - Maximum subarray sum
   - Climbing stairs
   - Word ladder / shortest transformation sequence using BFS
   - Topological sort and cycle detection in a directed graph
   - All paths or number of paths in a DAG between two nodes
   - Trapping rain water / largest rectangle in a histogram

3.  SQL Problems
   - Find nth highest salary from Employee table
   - Multi-table joins (Employee, Department, Project associations)
   - Complex GROUP BY & HAVING clauses (group by month/year)
   - Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)
   - Subquery-based filtering (find employees without manager)
   - Query optimization and index design
