CODING TOPICS FOR REACT/FRONTEND:
1. Core JS Coding & Logic Tasks
- Build a counter using functions (increment, decrement, reset).
- Implement a To-Do list using arrays and objects (add, edit, delete, mark complete).
- Implement search, filter, and pagination logic on an array of data (simulate API data).
- Create a modal toggle simulation (open/close states managed via variables).
- Implement a simple form validation checker (required fields, email format, length limit).

2. Intermediate JavaScript Logic
- Implement debounce and throttle manually.
- Flatten nested arrays/objects (both shallow and deep).
- Perform deep equality check between two objects.
- Implement a simple caching/memoization function.
- Toggle dark/light theme using stored state simulation (localStorage mock).
- Implement an infinite scroll data loader simulation (no React, only logic).

3. Data Structures & Algorithms (JS Focus)
- Implement LRU cache using Map and a doubly linked list (or arrays if simpler).
- Implement a basic Trie for autocomplete suggestions from a word list.
- Implement a Min/Max heap and use it for top-K elements in an array.
- Implement deep clone for complex nested objects/arrays (handling edge cases like circular references can be a bonus).
- Implement a simple diff between two objects (return added/removed/changed keys).
